# Contributing to KnitSoftware Website

Thank you for being part of the KnitSoftware development team. This document outlines our guidelines for contributing to the KnitSoftware website project. Please note that this is a private project, and contributions are limited to team members who have been explicitly invited.

## Workflow for Collaboration

To maintain the quality of our codebase and ensure efficient collaboration, we follow a structured workflow:

### 1. Collaborator Access

- Access to contribute is granted by the project administrators to specific team members.

### 2. Issue Creation

- Before starting work, check the issue tracker to avoid duplicate efforts.
- If you identify a bug or have a feature request, create a new issue, providing as much detail as possible.

### 3. Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch for your work from the `main` branch.
  - For features: `feature/your-feature-name`
  - For bug fixes: `bug/your-bug-name`

### 4. Commit Messages

- Write clear, concise commit messages, describing what was changed and why.

### 5. Pull Requests

- Once development is complete, submit a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch.
- In the PR, reference any related issues and summarize the changes made.
- Ensure your code passes all checks and tests before requesting a review.

### 6. Code Reviews

- At least one other team member must review and approve the PR.
- Address feedback and make required changes promptly.

### 7. Merging

- After receiving approval, PRs can be merged into the `main` branch.
- Delete your branch after merging to keep the repository clean.

## Coding Standards

- **Code Style**: Follow our coding style guidelines and use linters configured for our project.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for new code and ensure existing tests pass.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes or add new documentation as needed.

## Communication

- We use Discord for team discussions. Please keep project-related discussions in our project channel.
- Use GitHub comments for discussion related to specific issues or pull requests.

## Security

- Do not commit sensitive information into the repository. Use environment variables for configuration.
