# Project Architecture - KnitSoftware Website

## Introduction

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the KnitSoftware Website, designed to provide both developers and stakeholders with an understanding of the system's structure and components.

## Overview

The KnitSoftware Website is a full-stack application that leverages React and Next.js for a dynamic frontend experience, coupled with a robust Java Spring Boot backend. This combination facilitates a rich user interface with efficient server-side processing and database interaction.

## Frontend Architecture

### Technologies

- **React**: Utilized for building interactive UI components.
- **Next.js**: Empowers the application with server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides a comprehensive framework for developing responsive and mobile-first web pages.

### Structure

- **/pages**: Contains the application's page components, each representing a distinct route.
- **/components**: Houses reusable UI components for consistency and modularity.
- **/public** and **/styles**: Store static assets and CSS/SCSS files, respectively.

### State Management

- Uses React Hooks for managing local component states.
- Global state management (if implemented) is handled via Context API or Redux for more complex state logic.

## Backend Architecture

### Technologies

- **Java**: The core programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.

### Structure

- **Controllers**: Manage incoming HTTP requests and route them to appropriate services.
- **Services**: Implement the business logic layer, processing data and applying business rules.
- **Repositories**: Interface with the database, abstracting data persistence and retrieval.
- **Models**: Define the application's data structure and relationships.

### Database

- Preference for a relational database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), facilitated by JPA for object-relational mapping.

## Deployment

The application leverages AWS services for deployment and hosting:

- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Automates the deployment process, from capacity provisioning to load balancing.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Manages relational databases.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used for storing static files and assets.

## Development Practices

- **Version Control**: Managed with Git, employing a strategy that includes feature branches, a development branch, and a main branch for production releases.
- **CI/CD**: Integration of GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD tool) automates the testing and deployment processes.

## Security Measures

- Enforces HTTPS to secure communications.
- Implements JWT or Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.
- Prioritizes input validation to mitigate common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

## Conclusion

This architecture document provides a foundational overview of the KnitSoftware Website's design and structure. It serves as a guide for current and future development efforts and should be updated to reflect any significant architectural changes.
